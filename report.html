    <h1>Introduction/Planning/Background</h1>
        <h2>How did you approach the subject? what does your site say about your future you?</h2>
        <h3>I approached the the subject by first searching the internet for portfolios which were
            <li>https://una.im/about/</li>
            <li>https://www.alexdram.com/</li>
            <li>http://tangyidesign.com/</li>
            <p>
            From my observation of these three out of many website of portfolios I have concluded that each portfolio is design in a way that reflects the person characteristics, their achievements , skills and overall their behaviorâ€™s give an example una.im provides a serious but cute behaviour and characteristic in their portfolio due to using picture of ponies and pink and low tone pink colour to describe probably her (women) . Another example is alexdram who provided me with a interactive website that allows user to experience joy in my opinion as just working out that you have to scroll down and also as you scroll down the entire website becomes attached to your cursor and screen as your in control which gave feeling such as creativity and antagonised the brain where curiosity is set. </p>
<p>For their description of their skills and who there are they, they portrayed with detail and professionalism by stating or adding links to their achievements which portrayed what kind of skills they have and what they have gone through to achieve those skills. The only similarities that I saw was they kept it short and readable to not bore the user into sleeplessness or loss of interest on their description of themselves</p>
<p>After i researched those three i started compiling what im going to write in each page which you can see in my word document listed</p>
            <li><a href= "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HEuhYsm7RxBnjWnSKlexF_p6hPpeacxh?usp=sharing"> Word Document</a></li>
        after creating the wire frames and the word document that shows what i placed in the website , i started looking for my pictures. After locating them i inserted them into my pictures folder.
            
<p>In terms of coding i started by making the pages and saving them in the folder called Programming language. Then i started to type up the text from the word document. When i finished writing up the text i started with the head section which had my logo, my title and my navigation bar. Each problem that i stumbled upon i would do research on what i want and then try to implement the ideas into the website for examaple how to create a slideshow. After i created the head i started working on the footer because it was simple and needed only a couple of elements to produce. Completion of the footer and the header made my job more easier in which i could now copy and paste the same type of coding implement it into other pages and change it up corresponding to the pages desire. Each step of the way i checked through my wireframe if its looks what i wanted it to look which indeed it is.Once done with the bottom and top section of the page i started implementing the middle which was the most difficult job to do as it created obsticles which i overcame. For example how to create a slideshow or to resize pictures and remove background which where not part of the html or css or javascript structure i had to use other resources to gather those element and then implement them into the structure.</p>
            
            <p>Within the process of the creation of the website i had more elements that displayed on t he wireframe due to i thought it needs more an appealing view or it needs to present certain characters for example changing the navigation from the slideshow to the bottom center instead of the side gave it more a simpler feeling.</p>
            
            <p> The wireframe were created with the intention of simplicitiy but also high quality feeling due each portfolio is different and that i wanted my one to be simple but high quality design. The wireframe is intended and was used as intended as a guide line for my entire website design however during the process some features were altered to meet my likability. Thats when you see on the wireframe some features are not displayed.</p>

        <h1>Planning</h1>
        <h3>
        I made the site easy to navigatie through a navigation bar in the top right corner of the screen and also a single links on my image which sent the user to the homepage.
        For social links i created images in the footer and connected them with a hyperlinks in which when clicked upon they will send to the right internet address.
        </h3>
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        
        <h3>Resources used in creation:
            <li>Youtube</li>
            <li>W3Schools</li>
            <li>css-tricks</li>
            <li>overflow</li>
           <li> google fonts</li>
           <li> and other websites.</li>
            For images i legally contacted the pursonnel who created and asked for permission and secondly i used website such as https://unsplash.com/
        </h3>
        <h1>Evaluation</h1>
        <h2>What worked well</h2>
        <h3>Everything that i created in the website works to my design in which it was intended to however i wanted to improve the website i would firstly. Create more colour in the pages due to the fact it looks fairly bland however there are hints of colour which do create a more personalised feeling
        
            <p>Secondly i would probably create an animation or a interactive page which you could interactive with me and other user while your on the website even if for fun.</p>
