            Experience high situation of crashings
        </h1>
        <h2>
            User through the ages have experienced crashes on their computer for ages and these solution that I will provide will help you solve them.
        </h2>
        <p>
            First task is Check your temperature on your CPU or GPU. The heat is one of the common issues that involves crashes on a computer. 
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Changing the thermal paste. Changing the thermal paste will reduce the heat because there will be more contact between the layer of your CPU or GPU and heat sink. This means that there will be more dissipation of heat .
        </li>
        <li>
            Cleaning the computer . Cleaning the computer will provide more air flow for the heat to dissipate from the heat sink . The heat arises due to not enough air flow being pushed through the system as one of two ways you can cool the CPU and GPU of your computer is through air
        </li>
        <li>
            Changing of cooling system from air to water. Changing the your heat sink from air cooled to water cooled reduce significantly as water absorbs heat more efficiently due to their molecule structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changing the computer case . Computer cases are important as their structure the entire layout of the computer however some manufactories do not provide clear and understandable methods of cooling your system for example providing only a single ventilation hole for the entire system will significantly increase the heat and reduce heat expulsion due to not having enough air flowing through the system .
        </li>
        <li>
            Changing CPU or GPU. Old Hard always creates more heats than it needs to due to their advancement were in heat transfer arenâ€™t great as they are now.
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>
            Maintenance
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Maintenance is needed for a computer to function at is best capability as any element that does not allow a computer to function properly for example dust on fan, the computer will start showing signs of problem for example crashes.
        </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
            Cleaning your computer from dust will greatly decrease problem as more air flow means more cooling for the computer as more air flow passes through it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Changing the thermal paste will reduce heat as more contact is made with the CPU or GPU  and the heat sink.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cleaning any glass will provide a clean profile of the computer.
        </li>
